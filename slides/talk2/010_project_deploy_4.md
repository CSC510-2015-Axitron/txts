# Project Details: Deployment Options

__Unity Webplayer__

[Unity](http://www.unity3d.com)


_Pros_

* Unity webplayer worked well in our testing
* Web based deployment possible
* Unity scripts are written in in C#, Javascript, or Boo so time to learn the scripting lanugage should be reasonably short
* Unity has been used for successful commercial games


_Cons_

* Group members don't know Unity, or the languages used for Unity scripting
* May be difficult to do the procedural generation of levels we want to do with Unity Scripting.
* Our game will likely be built in 2d and Unity may end up being overkill
