# Project Details: Mechanical Turk

* [Mechanical Turk](https://www.mturk.com/mturk/help?helpPage=overview) is a platform for paying users perform HITs (Human Intelligence Tasks)
* Surveys are a commonly used HIT in Mechanical Turk
* Our plan is to place a survey on Mechanical Turk with a link to either the application as a download, or a web based version of our game
* Once they have played procedurally generated and manually generated levels in the game they will respond to survey questions indicating their thoughts on each option
* The best way seems to be to deploy via the web and then workers can get to the game without a download
* This would likely result in the largest amount of users playing our game and taking the survey
