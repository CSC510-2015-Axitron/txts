#Conclusions
There were two parts to our question, but without more work we can only answer one of them.

Comparing the difficulty of handcrafted content to procedural content,

* Handcrafted content is more time consuming to develop
    + Tools don't take too long
    + Easier to get what you want
    + Very time consuming to make enough
* Procedural content is quicker
    + More difficult to make interesting
    + Can be time consuming to tune
* Solution: use both!
    + Most developers have a mix of procedural and handcrafted
    + Common combination: Handcrafted pieces put together by procedure
