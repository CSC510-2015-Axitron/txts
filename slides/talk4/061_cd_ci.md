# Continuous Integration & Deployment
### Defining terms:

- CI (Continuous Integration) - As defined by Martin Fowler "a software development practice where members of a team integrate their work frequently, usually each person integrates at least daily - leading to multiple integrations per day. Each integration is verified by an automated build (including test) to detect integration errors as quickly as possible. Many teams find that this approach leads to significantly reduced integration problems and allows a team to develop cohesive software more rapidly."
- CD (Continuous Deployment/Delivery) - Per Fitzgerald and Sol "Continuous deployment is the practice of continuously deploying good software builds automatically to some environment, but not necessarily to actual users."
