#Testing

Testing is being done using the following tools:

- [Mocha Testing Framework](http://mochajs.org/)
- [Chai Assertions](http://chaijs.com/)
- [JShint Static Analysis](http://jshint.com/)

Originally testing was done using a TestRig made by Mr. Morrow, but 
we moved to a more formal type of testing as time went on to hook in
with our Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment systems.
