#Idea

Many indie games have procedural content generation

* Is it worth it?
    + How difficult to implement?
    + How much do users like it?
* What sort of algorithms are out there?
    + L-Systems
    + Noise
    + Others?

#Project Proposed
Simple game with both procedural and hand-crafted content

Mazes:

<img align=right src="../img/project_proposal/maze.png">

* Simple concept and execution
* Lots of ways to make mazes, even given constraints
    + Square space, grid movement
    + Each location has 4 possible doors/walls
* Many established maze generation algorithms
    + Search algs
    + Kruskal's alg
    + Prim's alg
    + Recursive division
    + etc...

#Project Details: Static/Handmade Content

<img align=right src="../img/project_proposal/datafile.png">

Pros

* Quick to implement
* High developer control
* Same experience every game

Cons

* Slow to create content
* Same experience every game

#Project Details: Procedural Content

Pros

* No/few content developers necessary
* (Semi) endless variety
* Different experience every game

<p align=right >$u(t,x) = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{\pi\alpha t}} \exp \left ( -\frac{x^2}{4\alpha t} \right )$</p>

Cons

* Difficult to implement
* Different experience every game
* Medium/low developer control over content

#Project Details: Deployment Options

__Web Based__

* Java Applet
* Lua Webplayer
* Unity Webplayer

__Executable Based__

* Local Java Application

#Project Details: Data collection

__Market analysis__

* Total downloads and frequency
* User ratings
* Number of referrals

__Gamer behavior__

* Game time and frequency
* Time spent on static and procedural contents
* Gamer preference, strategy, and steps

# Formulas

- And the answer is...
- $f(x)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}(x-a)^n$
